"""The `limit` invariant, asserted as a property rather than per tool.

eco-app#6076 argues the class: `limit` must bound every array that grows with
world size, and truncation must never be silent. Three rounds of fixing the
next demonstrated instance did not converge, so the rule is pinned here.

What this covers and what it does not, stated plainly because a green suite
should not be read as more than it proves:

* The two bounding helpers are exercised exhaustively. Both are shared, so a
  tool routing through either inherits the contract.
* The set of tools advertising `limit` is pinned, so adding a `limit`-bearing
  tool without wiring it to a helper trips a test rather than shipping.

It does NOT drive all 21 tools end to end against truncating fixtures, which
would need each one's upstream mocked.
